# Open Bullion

An academic cryptocurrency-based commodities exchange for trading gold and silver futures with stablecoin settlement.

Built as a learning platform to explore exchange mechanics — order matching, margin trading, liquidation, funding rates, and price discovery — in a controlled, low-stakes environment.

## Features

- **Futures trading** — Gold (XAU-PERP) and Silver (XAG-PERP) perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage
- **Order matching engine** — price-time priority, partial fills, self-trade prevention
- **Margin system** — initial/maintenance margin, mark pricing, and automatic liquidation
- **Funding rates** — 8-hour intervals to keep futures prices anchored to spot
- **Wallet system** — USDC deposits and withdrawals with balance tracking
- **Liquidity provision** — one-click LP tool for placing two-sided limit orders
- **Educational docs** — focused user guides for onboarding, futures, wallet operations, and fees
- **Live price feed** — Gold and silver index prices from metals.dev API

- A [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) project with Google sign-in enabled
- A [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) store (Neon)
- A [metals.dev](https://metals.dev) API key (free tier, optional — falls back to hardcoded prices)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/chandreshkkhatri/openmandi.git
cd openmandi
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your values (see Environment Variables below)

# Push database schema
npx drizzle-kit push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values. You can also run `vercel env pull .env.local` to pull from Vercel (then add `METALS_DEV_API_KEY` manually).

## Real Deposit Flow (On-Chain)

Deposits are no longer instant DB credits.

1. User requests deposit instructions (`/api/wallet/deposit`) and gets token + network + exchange address.
2. User sends funds on-chain.
3. User submits transaction hash (`/api/wallet/deposit/claim`).
4. Cron route (`/api/cron/sync-deposits`) verifies receipt/logs and credits wallet only after required confirmations.

Configure Vercel cron in `vercel.json` and set `CRON_SECRET` in environment variables.

## Real Withdrawal Flow (On-Chain)

1. User submits withdrawal request with destination address (`/api/wallet/withdraw`).
2. Requested amount + fee are held by reducing `availableBalance`.
3. Cron route (`/api/cron/sync-withdrawals`) broadcasts payout via `WITHDRAWAL_BROADCAST_URL`.
4. After on-chain confirmation, cron finalizes ledger entries and debits wallet `balance`.
5. Failed payouts are marked rejected and held funds are released back to `availableBalance`.

## Internal Exchange Wallet Management (Sprint 7 Scope)

Sprint 7 includes internal wallet operations, not just user-facing deposit/withdrawal UX.

- Internal wallet roles: hot wallet, treasury wallet, fee wallet, reserve wallet
- Liability controls: user-funds segregation from exchange fee/revenue funds
- Risk controls: operational float thresholds, payout throttles, emergency pause switches
- Reconciliation: periodic on-chain balances vs internal ledger balances with alerting
- Operations: treasury rebalance flows and manual-review queues for exceptions

Current implementation covers user wallet lifecycle and monitoring; internal wallet orchestration and reconciliation controls are part of remaining Sprint 7 work.

## Deferred Modules (Future Scope)

- Transparency dashboard and transparency documentation
- Technical/developer documentation portal

These modules were removed from the active MVP navigation and routes to keep current scope focused on core trading + wallet operations.

## Wallet Monitoring (Admin)

- Admin API: `GET /api/admin/wallet-monitor`
- Auth: requires logged-in user email in `ADMIN_EMAILS`
- Returns rejected and stale deposit/withdrawal operations for operations monitoring.

## Market Maker & Hedger

Two standalone scripts provide liquidity and risk management. They run independently of the Next.js app — only a `POSTGRES_URL` (and Binance keys for hedging) are required.

### Market Maker

Places 5 levels of bid/ask orders per pair (Gold & Silver), mirroring Binance prices with configurable spreads. Orders auto-refresh every 5 seconds.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/market-maker.ts                # default tag "local"
npx tsx scripts/market-maker.ts --tag=aws-1    # multi-instance support
```

Each `--tag` creates a separate system user so multiple instances don't cancel each other's orders.

**Deploying with PM2:**

To run the Market Maker continuously in the background (e.g. on a VM), use PM2:

1. Install `tsx` globally so PM2 can execute TypeScript:
   ```bash
   npm install -g tsx
   ```
2. Start the script with PM2 and save it to auto-restart:

   ```bash
   # For Development
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start scripts/market-maker.ts --interpreter tsx --name "openmandi-mm-dev"
   pm2 save

   # For Production (Recommended: Compile first to save memory)
   npx tsc scripts/market-maker.ts
   pm2 start scripts/market-maker.js --name "openmandi-mm-prod"
   pm2 save
   ```

### Hedger

Monitors fills against the market maker and automatically places hedge orders on Binance Futures to stay delta-neutral.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/hedger.ts --dry-run            # test mode (no real orders)
npx tsx scripts/hedger.ts --testnet            # use Binance Futures testnet
npx tsx scripts/hedger.ts                      # production (real Binance orders)
```

**Getting started with testnet:**

1. Go to [testnet.binancefuture.com](https://testnet.binancefuture.com) and log in with GitHub
2. Copy your testnet API key and secret
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_key
   BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_secret
   ```
4. Run: `npx tsx scripts/hedger.ts --testnet`

For **production hedging**, use real Binance API keys from [Binance API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management) (enable Futures, disable Withdrawals) and omit the `--testnet` flag.

## Scripts

| Command                           | Description                      |

| `npm run build`                   | Production build                 |
| `npm run start`                   | Start production server          |
| `npm run lint`                    | Run ESLint                       |
| `npx drizzle-kit push`            | Push schema changes to database  |
| `npx drizzle-kit studio`          | Open Drizzle Studio (DB browser) |
| `npx tsx scripts/market-maker.ts` | Start market maker bot           |
| `npx tsx scripts/hedger.ts`       | Start Binance hedger             |

## Architecture

The app uses **Next.js route groups** to separate concerns — each group has its own layout: marketing (navbar + footer), docs (sidebar + header), exchange (app sidebar + navbar), auth (centered minimal), and legal (centered prose). The exchange layout verifies the user session server-side and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

The **trading engine** runs synchronous order matching inside a database transaction. When an order is placed, it scans the opposite side of the book for price-compatible resting orders, executes fills at the resting order's price, and updates balances atomically. Futures use a mark price (70% index + 30% mid) for margin calculations, with a liquidation engine that force-closes positions below maintenance margin.

Firebase and database connections use a **lazy initialization pattern** — they return safe no-ops during build time when environment variables aren't set, preventing build failures on Vercel.
