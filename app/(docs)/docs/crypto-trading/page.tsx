      <h1>Crypto-Powered Commodities Trading</h1>

      <p className="lead">
        Spikey Coins combines two worlds: traditional commodities trading and
        modern cryptocurrency. Instead of wiring money through a bank, you use
        stablecoins to trade gold and silver futures. Here&apos;s how it all
        fits together.
      </p>

      <h2>What are Stablecoins?</h2>
      <p>
        Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable
        value. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in price,
        stablecoins are pegged to real-world currencies &mdash; usually the US
        dollar.
      </p>
      <p>Spikey Coins accepts two stablecoins:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>USDT (Tether)</strong> &mdash; the most widely used stablecoin,
          where 1 USDT is designed to equal 1 US dollar
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>USDC (USD Coin)</strong> &mdash; a fully-reserved stablecoin
          backed by US dollar assets, where 1 USDC is designed to equal 1 US
          dollar
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Use Stablecoins for Trading?</h2>
      <p>
        Using stablecoins instead of traditional money offers several advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed</strong> &mdash; crypto transactions settle in minutes,
          not days. Traditional bank wires can take 1-3 business days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility</strong> &mdash; anyone with an internet
          connection can participate. No need for a bank account or brokerage
          relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency</strong> &mdash; blockchain transactions are
          publicly verifiable. You can confirm that deposits and withdrawals
          actually happened.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower barriers</strong> &mdash; traditional futures brokers
          often require large minimum deposits. Spikey Coins lets you start with
          as little as $5.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Your Funds are Managed</h2>
      <p>
        When you deposit USDT or USDC into Spikey Coins, your balance is tracked
        on the platform. Your funds are used as collateral for trading futures
        and can be exchanged between USDT and USDC using the built-in stablecoin
        exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every transaction &mdash; deposits, withdrawals, trades, and fees
        &mdash; is recorded in a transparent ledger that you can review at any
        time.
      </p>

      <h2>Settlement and Finality</h2>
      <p>
        When a trade is matched on Spikey Coins, settlement happens
        immediately. There&apos;s no waiting period. Your balances are updated
        in real time, and your positions reflect current market prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a major advantage over traditional markets, where settlements
        can take two business days (known as T+2 settlement).
      </p>

      <h2>The Two-Stablecoin System</h2>
      <p>
        An interesting feature of Spikey Coins is that USDT and USDC trade
        against each other on an open market. Even though both are designed to
        be worth $1, the exchange rate between them on our platform is determined
        by supply and demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the rate might be slightly above or below 1:1 at any given
        time, depending on what traders are buying and selling. This teaches an
        important concept about how markets work: prices are determined by
        participants, not by decree.
      </p>
