      <p className="lead">
        Transparency is a core value at Open Mandi. We believe you should know
        exactly what you&apos;re paying, why you&apos;re paying it, and where
        that money goes. Here&apos;s a complete breakdown of every fee on the
        platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Fee Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Fees on Open Mandi serve two purposes: they sustain the platform and
        they teach you how fees work on real exchanges. Every fee collected is
        visible on the{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/transparency">Transparency Dashboard</Link>, so you
        can see exactly how much revenue the exchange generates.
      </p>

      <h2>Trading Fees (Futures)</h2>
      <p>
        When you trade gold or silver futures, you pay a small fee based on the
        trade value. Fees differ depending on whether you&apos;re a{" "}
        <strong>maker</strong> or a <strong>taker</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Maker</strong> &mdash; you place a limit order that adds
          liquidity to the order book (your order sits on the book waiting to be
          matched)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taker</strong> &mdash; you place an order that immediately
          matches with an existing order, removing liquidity from the book
        </li>
      </ul>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Fee Type</th>
            <th>Rate</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Maker Fee</td>
            <td>0.02%</td>
            <td>Paid when your limit order is filled by another trader</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Taker Fee</td>
            <td>0.05%</td>
            <td>Paid when you fill an existing order on the book</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Makers get lower fees because they provide liquidity, which makes the
        market healthier for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Exchange Fees (USDT/USDC)</h2>
      <p>
        The same maker/taker model applies to the stablecoin exchange:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Fee Type</th>
            <th>Rate</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Maker Fee</td>
            <td>0.01%</td>
            <td>Limit orders that add liquidity to the USDT/USDC book</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Taker Fee</td>
            <td>0.03%</td>
            <td>Orders that immediately match on the USDT/USDC book</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Exchange fees are slightly lower than futures trading fees because
        stablecoin swaps are simpler transactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Deposit Fees</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No fees</strong>. Deposits are free on Open Mandi. You may pay
        network transaction fees (gas fees) on the blockchain side, but the
        platform itself does not charge for deposits.
      </p>

      <h2>Withdrawal Fees</h2>
      <p>
        A small flat fee is charged to cover blockchain transaction costs:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Currency</th>
            <th>Fee</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>USDT</td>
            <td>$0.10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>USDC</td>
            <td>$0.10</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Complete Fee Schedule</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Activity</th>
            <th>Fee</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Futures Trading (Maker)</td>
            <td>0.02%</td>
            <td>Of trade value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Futures Trading (Taker)</td>
            <td>0.05%</td>
            <td>Of trade value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stablecoin Exchange (Maker)</td>
            <td>0.01%</td>
            <td>Of trade value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stablecoin Exchange (Taker)</td>
            <td>0.03%</td>
            <td>Of trade value</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Deposit</td>
            <td>Free</td>
            <td>Network fees may apply</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Withdrawal</td>
            <td>$0.10</td>
            <td>Flat fee per withdrawal</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
