        <li>
          The Platform offers perpetual futures contracts referencing the spot

          instruments that do not confer ownership of the underlying commodity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Futures trading involves the use of leverage, which amplifies both

        </li>
        <li>

          The Platform shall bear no liability for losses resulting from
          liquidation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mark price used for liquidation and profit/loss calculations is
          derived from external price feeds and the Platform&apos;s order book
          data. The Platform does not guarantee the accuracy of external price
          feeds.

        <li>
          All fees collected by the Platform are publicly visible on the
